(HAGAN "GIT PULL ORIGIN (nombre de la rama)" Y LUEGO SIGAN LAS INSTRUCCIONES, NO ES NECESARIO NADA MAS)

Install "node.js", copy and paste the following link and the download will start:

```
https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.16.1/node-v18.16.1-x64.msi
```

To install TailWind, do this:

```
npm install
```

And then

To run TailWind use:

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```
After that you must use other BASH to use git because the first one would be runing the TailWind serve and you will need that to 
be able to use it.
If you want to STOP the serve, just use: Ctrl + C to do it. It must move you back to the normal git bash.
